# Covid-19-Ventilator-Software-
Software to improve monitoring and control of the Covid-19 ventilator 

Background:  The shortage of ventilators for Covid-19 patients has presented the technical community with a generational challenge.  Novel ventilator designs are already emerging that allow for fast production.   Our software will be targeted to the ventilators based on the [Equilibar back-pressure regulator](https://www.equilibar.com/fullly-automated-oscillatory-pressure-wave-system/), but it will be applicable to other systems that have common needs for monitoring and control.  

Goals:  The goal is a software solution that enhances the performance of the Covid-19 ventilator.  Functions of the softwre are:

* Display of pressure and flow conditions in the ventilator.
* Control of the pressure and flow conditions in the ventilator.  

The software will meet the [requirements for the Covid-19 ventilator](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FNPwrQjB1qW1330s5-S_-VB0vDHajMWKieJRjINCNeE/edit) published by Julian Botta, an Emergency Medicine Physcian at Johns Hopkins University.


Requirements of the software solution are:

* Stability.  The software components will function in a safety-critical application.
* Distributable.  The software will be easily installed.
* User-friendly.  The software will require minimal training.
* Secure.  The software will be immune from malicious activity.
* Approvable.  The software must ultimately be able to obtain fast-track approval for clinical use (FDA in USA).
